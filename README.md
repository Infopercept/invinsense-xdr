# An Integrated Detection and Response with Attacker’s Sense

### Extended Detection and Response is effective against all kinds of cyberattacks and adversaries, but only when it gets integrated and coordinated intelligence from the key cybersecurity solutions.

Invensense XDR is one of the most integrated XDR that combines intelligence of the key cybersecurity solutions- - SIEM, SOAR, EDR, Case Management, Threat Intelligence, Threat Exchange, and other cybersecurity solutions. Invinsense XDR integrates these elements in such a way that it becomes a cybersecurity ecosystem that acts at the level of adversaries. This ecosystem combines automated and human efforts mapped around attacker’s tactics and neutralize all kinds of threats. Its integration with threat intelligence and threat exchange makes sure that the system learns from it and becomes more agile towards similar attacks in the future.

## INVINSENSE XDR WORKS ON THE OODA APPROACH


The OODA loop is a four-stage process of decision making: Observe, Orient, Decide & Act. Invinsense XDR will cycle through the phases strategically and rapidly as part of the analysis and decision-making process. During a cybersecurity incident, a quick and precise reaction is crucial. The OODA loop followed by Invinsense XDR is designed to help your team make decisions and take action rather than freezing up and doing nothing. At its core, the OODA loop is a process for identifying and analysing how a living being thinks, acts, responds, and adapts to stimuli. This process is invaluable to your security team and has numerous applications, both offensive and defensive.
The Key Highlights Include :
-	Digital landscape of each customer is different, Invinsense OODA allows customization to fit all types of requirements.
-	Offers API based integration with 200+ vendors.
-	Automated mapping with MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## COMPLETE VISIBILITY AND RESPONSE TO ADVANCED THREATS WITH EDR AND SIEM.
EDR and SIEM are two important components of an organization’s security strategy. The EDR component provides enhanced endpoint visibility and ensures a faster response time. it spots unknown types of malware hence can protect your organization from advanced malware. On the other hand, SIEM is important because it collects a lot of data from various components of your network, analyzes it for any sign of malicious activities, filters, and prioritizes the alerts to provide an attack timeline that ultimately helps organizations to understand the attacks and stop them. Weaved together EDR and SIEM offer actionable intelligence through threat patterns and active response capabilities that can block network attacks and stop lateral threat movement. The EDR and SIEM components of Invinsense XDR are powered by Wazuh. They provide complete network visibility and help security analysts discover and investigate threats and attacks.

## COLLECTIVE SECURITY ORCHESTRATION AUTOMATION AND RESPONSE.
SOAR is a collection of tools that enable organizations to collect inputs from different sources like SIEM, EDR, AV etc. monitored by the security team. The SOAR component of Invinsese XDR is based on Shuffle. This provides incident analysis and response by leveraging a combination of human and machine intelligence. The incident analysis and response procedures are provided by workflows and playbooks
